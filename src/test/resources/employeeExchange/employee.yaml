  Employee exchange is a demo exchange REST APIs to get, add, delete and
  update employees and a websocket endpoint to get notified of updates from an employee database.<br>
  A server can be started using <code>org.jxapi.exchanges.employee.EmployeeExchangeServer</code> class to serve these APIs.<br>
  The URL of the HTTP server and Websocket server must be set using the ${config.baseHttpUrl} and ${config.baseWebsocketUrl} properties.<br>
