           Represents a configuration property or a group of properties of an exchange like authentication credentials 
           (API Key,secret) the wrapper client should provide to instantiate a wrapper.<br>
           Exchange descriptor may contain a list of such properties as value of
           'properties' property of exchange.<p>
           The name of a property should be spelled 'camelCase' like a Java variable
           name.
           <p>
           The value of a property can be a 'primitive' type e.g. {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#STRING},
           {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#INT}, {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#BOOLEAN}, 
           {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#BIGDECIMAL}, {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#LONG}. 
           It can't be a list, map, or object.<p>
           The properties will be exposed as static properties of a generated Java class named [exchangeId]Constants. 
           That class wlll list constants for property names and default values, and default 'getter' methods for 
           retrieving their values from properties
           <p>
           The properties can be grouped together. For example, authentication
           credentials can be grouped into a 'group' property called 'auth' with
           sub-properties for API key, secret, etc listed. Those properties can be
           referenced with key auth.apiKey, auth.apiSecret, etc. Groups may contain
           other groups, so the structure is hierarchical.

          The list of constants that are used in context of the exchange.wrapper, for instance specific values for some APIs request/response/message properties.<br>
          See {@link org.jxapi.exchange.descriptor.Constant} for details.
        objectDescription: | 
          Represents a constant value used across APIs of an exchange or a group of such constants.<br>
          Exchange descriptor may contain a list of such constants as value of
          'constants' property of exchange<br>
          Such constants will be exposed as static final fields in a generated Java
          class of the generated Java wrapper class for the exchange.<br>
          A constant may not be a final constant but a 'group' of constants that functionally come together.
          For example, when an exchange uses constants to represent bid or ask a side of, 
          it makes sense to group them together in a single constant group.
          In this case, final constants of the group will be exposed as static field of a nested public class
          in the main constant class, named after group name. A constant represents a group when its 
          <code>constants</code> property is set with a non empty list of nested constants<br>
          The name of a constant should be a valid camel case Java identifier.<br>
          The value of a constant must be a 'primitive' type e.g. {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#STRING},
          {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#INT}, {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#BOOLEAN}, 
          {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#BIGDECIMAL}, {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type#LONG}. 
          It can't be a list, map, or object. <code>value</code>
          and <code>type</code> properties are relevant only when constant is not a group.<br>
          The name of a constant should provide a more readable name for the value. The
          description allows to provide semantic details.<br>

              The type of the constant value, see {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Type}, should be a primitive type e.g. 'STRING', 'INT', 'LONG', 'BIGDECIMAL', 'BOOLEAN'.
              This property is relevant only when the constant is not a group of constants.

        objectDescription: |
          Represents a rate limit rule that applies to all API groups of the exchange.<br>
          Exchange descriptor may contain a list of such rate limit rules as value of
          'rateLimits' property of exchange.<br>
          Such rate limit rules will be applied to all endpoints of each API group of

            description: |
              The maximum number of requests that can be attempted
              within rolling time frame. A negative value means it
              should not be taken into account and this rate limit
              is expressed in cumulated weight.
            type: INT
          - name: granularity
            description: |
               The suggested granularity in ms to use when enforcing. This is the time unit used to keep
               track of rate limit state. <br>
               Every time a request is made, a request count is incremented for current time in ms, and 
               a total weight is incremented for current time in ms. These values are stored with granularity 
               that is if granularity is X ms, the counters are updated at time T are stored for
                grain N*X where N*X &lt;= T and (N+1)*X &gt; n <br>
               The grains for time older than rule's timeframe are purged before counting or updating.<br>
               The number/total weight of calls that occurred on rolling time frame is then the sum of 
               request count or weight for all grain.<br>
               Default is 10ms. The finer the granularity, the more precise
               the rate limit enforcement will be. However, the more memory will be used to
               keep track of state, and the more CPU will be used to update or evaluate it.<br>

              The list of REST endpoints that belong to this API group.
            objectDescription: |
              Describes a REST endpoint as part of a larger exchange API defined in a JSON document.
              These endpoints handle HTTP requests to a specific URL, process request parameters, and return a response.
              
              <h2>Endpoint Properties</h2>
              The endpoint is defined by the following properties:
              <ul>
                <li>{@code name}: A unique identifier for the endpoint.</li>
                <li>{@code httpClient}: The name of the HTTP client to use for this REST endpoint, as defined in exchange 'network' section. When not set, default client of API group is used.</li>
                <li>{@code description}: A brief summary of the endpoint's purpose.</li>
                <li>{@code url}: The URL of the endpoint.</li>
                <li>{@code httpMethod}: The HTTP method for the request (e.g., GET, POST).</li>
                <li>{@code request}: The data structure for the request.</li>
                <li>{@code response}: The data structure for the response.</li>
                <li>{@code requestWeight}: The cost of a request, used for rate limiting.</li>
                <li>{@code rateLimits}: The rate limits applied to this endpoint.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Request Serialization</h2>
              <strong>Serialization to URL Parameters:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>For HTTP methods that do not have a request body (e.g., {@code GET}, {@code DELETE}), the request is serialized into either URL path parameters (e.g., {@code /value1/value2}) or query parameters (e.g., {@code ?param1=value1}).</li>
                <li>By default, request fields are serialized as query parameters. To serialize them as URL path parameters, set the {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Field#getIn()} property to {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.UrlParameterType#PATH}.</li>
                <li>If the request field is a primitive type, its value is URL-encoded and used as a single parameter.</li>
                <li>If the request field is an object without the {@code in} property set, its child fields are serialized as parameters.</li>
                <li>If the request field is an object with the {@code in} property set, or if it is a {@code MAP} or {@code LIST}, it is serialized as a URL-encoded JSON object.</li>
                <li>All field values are URL-encoded.</li>
              </ul>
              
              <h2>Code Generation</h2>
              API endpoints are defined as child elements of an {@code api} element in the JSON document (see {@link org.jxapi.exchange.descriptor.gen.ExchangeApiDescriptor}).
              This descriptor is used to generate method declarations in the API interface and their implementations.

              <h2>Request and Response Properties</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Both {@code request} and {@code response} are described as {@link org.jxapi.pojo.descriptor.Field} objects.</li>
                <li>The name of the {@code request} field becomes the argument name in the generated API method.</li>
                <li>The name of the {@code response} field is not used in code generation.</li>
                <li>If {@code request} is omitted, the generated method will have no arguments.</li>
                <li>If {@code response} is omitted, the method will return a {@code STRING} containing the raw response body. This is useful when only the status code is needed and the body is empty.</li>
              </ul>
